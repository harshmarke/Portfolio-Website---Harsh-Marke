                    <h4>Defence Exports Could Address the Gaps in India’s Foreign Engagements</h4>

                        <p class="para">India is set to export indigenous Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launchers (MBRL) to Armenia. The cost of this deal is estimated to be $250 million. This deal is indicative of India’s steady growth in defence manufacturing and exports. India’s defence exports for the year 2021-2022 were Rs.13,000 crore (about $1.6 billion), which is a record for India’s defence manufacturing sector. The defence exports grew by 54.1% compared to previous year. India’s defence exports have increased six times since 2014. 

                        In recent times, Argentina and Egypt have shown interest in purchasing Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas while the Philippines is set to purchase the BrahMos missiles.
                            
                        While India exports its indigenously manufactured defence equipment to 75 countries, destinations such as Armenia, Argentina, Egypt and the Philippines allow defence exports to address the gaps in India’s foreign engagements. 
                            
                        Defence exports complement India’s external engagements through a two-pronged approach. First is strengthening ties with countries like Armenia, Argentina and the Philippines with which India has limited engagements. This in turn would lead to India consolidating its presence in the regions like Eurasia, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Second, by way of defence exports, India could reset its ties with Egypt. While India and Egypt enjoyed close ties in the past, in recent years, India’s focus has shifted to the Gulf region and in particular on ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Reviving relations with Egypt would further strengthen India’s outreach to the Arab world and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region</p>
